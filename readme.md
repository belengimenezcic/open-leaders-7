## Digital Literacy and Security for the Visually Impaired

Hi! My name is Belén Giménez and as part of the Cohort 7 of the Mozilla Open Leaders, I say hello to you and I welcome you to this space! 
Due to need to teach about web literacy and digital security to everyone, and to the current lack of open technology resources easily available for the visually impaired community, the creation of spaces that could serve as useful materials and guides pertaining this issue, and focused on this community, was seen as a very important need. 

This is a space that serves as a repository to create and share material related to web literacy and digital security for the visually impaired community. The purpose of this spaces is to compile existing knowledge of open technology tools and resources, as well as the co-creation of a web literacy and digital security curriculum for this community. These resources can be adapted for every community according to its needs and context. 

Feel welcomed to reach out and contribute if you:

* Have knowledge of a useful tool, guide or material that could be located or mentioned in this repository as a resource
* Have some useful expertise in Design, Development and Usability
* Are passionate about Digital Security, Web Literacy and Digital Inclusion
* Have some ideas that could serve as opportunities that could escalate this project
